title:  "Starting Blogging!"
---

I have decided to start blogging.


Last year, I had a great chance to have visiting research at The University of Chicago,
and could experience an environment in a top-level research laboratory. 


As leading a life as a researcher (of statistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, cancer genomics) for about 10 years,
I’m feeling that the way researcher (should) works is now dramatically changing.
It a bit hard to give a detailed description of the change.
This change is closely linked to what revolutionarily changing every value in entire world, and I'm still in the early phase.
But one rather small-scale example is
"implementation of proposed methods is getting more than ever important".


This shift is nothing unusual.
Ten years ago, the priority (at least around me) was still put to just coming up with theoretically funcy methods, 
and implementation was secondary.
Since large-scale data analysis is now getting critical tasks for many people in various fields
who usually do not have deep statistical knowledge and are flooded with too much information, 
immediately available, easy-to-use and fast softwares will naturally beat theoretically-sounded but not well-implemented methods.
Therefore, acquiring computational skills will be mandatory to the researchers such as me.
But it was not easy for me (who initially raised as theoretical statistician) to accept that shift at heart, 
and the visiting research at U of C had turned out to be the finishing shot.
 

Of course, I had been feeling the importance of acquiring the computational skills.
However, there is some differences between from and after my stay in America.

1. Having observing the exact details the researchers at U of C are trying to acquire, my focus got more concentrated.
1. Keeping acquiring some skills is not an easy work. But I elaborated (and still improving) the way to make it a habit (which may be disclosed in the later posts). 

With the improved motivation and working-style, I have kept learning computational techniques for about one year,
and now I can start feeling the change in myself 
and am very excited to see what happen to me after several years.


I would like to use this blog mainly for writing the techniques I learned while acquiring the computational techniques (R, python, etc),
and several tips for sequencing analysis which I think may be helpful to the community.
Also, I may write about my research contents, and opinions on others’ academic papers.
I hope this blog will be helpful for both those with similar interest and myself.
