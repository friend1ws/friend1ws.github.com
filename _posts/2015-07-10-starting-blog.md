title:  "Starting Blogging!"
---

I have decided to start blogging.

I have several reasons for coming up starting blog.

One of the reason to starting blogging is:
Last year, I had a great chance to visit The University of Chicago,
and could feel what was going on in a top-level research laboratory. 

as having a life as a researcher (of statistics, machine learning, bioinformatics) for about 10 years,
now I’m feeling that the way researcher (should) works is dramatically changing.
E.g., ten years ago, the priority was put to coming up with novel methods, and implementation of them was secondary.
Now, the I believe the focus is shifting to qualities of implementation.
Preprocessing of the data is getting really tough,


Of course, I had been feeling the importance of acquiring the programming skills.
However, there is some differences between from and after my stay in America.
1. Having observing what kind of techniques researchers at the U of C is trying to acquire, my focus had become more concentrated.
2. Keeping acquiring some skills is not an easy work. But I elaborated the way to make the custom to do it (the detail of which may be disclosed in the later posts). 

With the improved lifestyle and motivation, I have kept learning for about one year,
and the effect was largely satisfying to me, and very excited to see what happen to me in several years.
So, I would like to use this blog mainly for writing the techniques I learned while acquiring the programming skills (R, python, etc),
and several tips for sequencing analysis which I think may be helpful for the community.
Also, I may write about my research contents, and opinions on others’ academic papers.
I hope I can improve communicating what I learn, help others with similar interests and hopefully having feedbacks from all over the world.
